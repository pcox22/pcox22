## Hi there 👋

### I'm Patrick Cox, an overachiever who's been adoring computers since 3rd Grade!

🔭 I’m concluding my work on Ledger - a Financial Solutions software project. It's a Blazor web-app using five languages and more libraries / dependencies! Check out my Ledger Repo if you're interested! My next step will be ExPokedle, and it'll be the most learning I've done in a while.

🌱 I’m currently learning the discord API while I develop my own bot: Scordle! Check out my Scordle Repo if you're interested! Similarly, I'll soon be tackling Angular and Supabase for ExPokedle.

🤔 Interests: I'd love to utilize a Full-Stack Engineering opportunity. I've got experience doing so, and I love all aspects of it!

📫 Contact me: Email me at 10jonathancox@gmail.com, or find me on LinkedIn!

😄 Pronouns: He/Him, all day - every day

⚡ Fun fact: I grew up in SouthWest Georgia, four hours from KSU where I graduated early with a degree in SWE! I had never seen a road with over 2 lanes until I was driving to KSU. Scary 😱!

💸 Occupation: For the last 2 years, I tutored underclassmen in C#, Java, and Python. I've been selected by KSU's College of Computing and Software Engineering to return as a Graduate Teaching Assistant and teach my own labs.

🏐 Hobbies: I love reading and watching shows with my friends! I'm sportier than I look - I enjoy running, and I can't get enough Volleyball, Pickleball, and Ping-Pong (so much that I reprogrammed Pong in PyGame!).
